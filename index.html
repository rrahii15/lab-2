        <h2>"I am originally from India and completed my 12th grade education there. After finishing school, I decided to pursue higher education in Canada, and I am currently studying at a college here. The experience of moving to a new country has been both exciting and enriching. It has allowed me to explore a different culture, meet people from diverse backgrounds, and expand my horizons. Adapting to a new educational system and environment has been a valuable learning experience that has helped me develop resilience and independence.</h2>
